May God bless you and reveal the\r\n      grace of His Son to you and keep you from evil. We don't know where we\r\n      came from: we can't say what we did a day ago. We don't know where we are\r\n      going: we can't say what will happen tomorrow. All we know is today: all\r\n      we know is right now. Today, is the day of salvation; right now, is the\r\n      time of God's favor. When you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.\r\n      The root of all disobedience and sin is unbelief; therefore, re-assure\r\n      yourself with the confidence which comes from faith in Jesus Christ. He\r\n      died for us, and was buried, and was raised, now living forever. Faith is\r\n      sight without seeing; the conviction of things unseen; the assurance of\r\n      things hoped for.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      Let us therefore remember the Lord's words to those who doubted in times\r\n      past and let us not shrink back in disbelief, but be strengthen by God's\r\n      grace moving forward, fearlessly, towards the heavenly prize which is ours\r\n      in Christ Jesus.

As it is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 8'\">\r\n        And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, imploring\r\n        Him, and saying, “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, fearfully\r\n        tormented.” Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.” But the\r\n        centurion said, “Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof,\r\n        but just say the word, and my servant will be healed. Now when Jesus\r\n        heard this, He marveled and said to those who were following, “Truly I\r\n        say to you, I have not found such <b>great faith</b>\r\n        with anyone in Israel.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 15'\">\r\n        And He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread\r\n        and throw it to the dogs.” But she said, “Yes, Lord; but even the dogs\r\n        feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” Then Jesus\r\n        said to her, “O woman, your <b>faith is great</b>; it shall be done for\r\n        you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed at once.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <br />\r\n\r\n      Finally, let us remember, all that is needed is a faith the size of a\r\n      mustard seed.

Even if\r\n      we are 'satisified' with all these pleasures of the world, it would not be\r\n      enough: it is like we are feeding a beast within us, the more we feed it\r\n      the stronger and bigger it gets. We eat food, and we are not content; we\r\n      drink drinks and we are not sustained; we eat and are hungry again later;\r\n      we drink and are thirsty again later. Also no matter how much the eye\r\n      sees, it is not enough; no matter how much the ear hears, it is not\r\n      content. If these kinds of pleasures truly makes us happy, why don't we\r\n      express it outwardly? If we are truly happy, shouldn't our happiness\r\n      resemble a child's happiness? Children are overcome with laughter and\r\n      express joyfulness and run around expressing their happiness. If these\r\n      things truly make us happy, why don't we show it? Most often we are\r\n      chained by such things, and we look miserable outwardly but inwardly, we\r\n      become less miserable than we were before because our pain has been masked\r\n      for a little while.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ecclesiastes 1'\">\r\n        All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it; the eye is not\r\n        satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

The human eye consists of 3 cones responsible for color vision:\r\n      red, green and blue; in the same way, these screens are made up of pixels\r\n      with these 3 colors. This is why only humans can see a computer screen or\r\n      television screen as intended -- it mimics the human eye. So, man learns\r\n      how God creates things then mimics it for his own purposes and desires:\r\n      air planes are another example of this, mimicking God's creation of birds\r\n      -- can you find other examples? In a computer, there are entire\r\n      simulations that are created and essentially allow people to live a new\r\n      life inside of.

Which do you like better - name brand goods\r\n      or the knock offs? Yes, knock offs are cheaper and require less of us, but\r\n      they are not better even in the slightest.

We work and sleep and do it all over again\r\n      the next day. And for what? To live for the weekend, the couple days we\r\n      have freedom? We live our lives one week at a time, for a couple days at a\r\n      time. We receive wages for our toil, but we have no time to spend the\r\n      money we have earned; even then, our money is given right back in the form\r\n      of bills and taxes. Our days are short yet we spend them in pain and agony\r\n      from our much work and labor. We work for things that will not matter in\r\n      the future; we work for objectives that will not matter years from now\r\n      because everything will become old and outdated eventually. In the future,\r\n      people will look back and not care what we did. Yet, we strive and labor\r\n      and don't receive our due wages for the amount of work we actually put in;\r\n      instead, a boss does little work and eats the fruits of our labor. What is\r\n      the best use of time in our short lives? By studying these days we live\r\n      in, are not our days evil? We re-live the same things over and over like a\r\n      rat in a maze. We don't know where we are going; we don't know where we\r\n      came from; we chase things we think will satisfy us, but chase them\r\n      forever without being satisfied.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ecclesiastes 2'\">\r\n        I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must\r\n        leave it to the man who will come after me, and who knows whether he\r\n        will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled\r\n        and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity. So I turned about\r\n        and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the\r\n        sun, because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge\r\n        and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not\r\n        toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. What has a man from\r\n        all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?\r\n        For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in\r\n        the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Life is short, and we spend our lives wasting our time for things that\r\n      will pass away even as we are passing away. What then, is there any way\r\n      around this? Isn't this the same nature of every human being born into\r\n      this world? A doctor goes in and out of surgery, working hard all the days\r\n      of his life, but hardly has time to enjoy his family. His surgeries are\r\n      meticulous; his hands are steady; his mind is clear. The worse case\r\n      scenario is death; the best case scenario is a life saved. If a doctor is\r\n      so steady handed in these life-and-death cases and God gives him peace,\r\n      why do we think so seriously of our jobs which aren't about life or death?\r\n      We instead ought to have peace in our toil realizing how futile it really\r\n      is. We should search for a work that truly matters; a work that is\r\n      eternal; a work that is forever-more. We can work with sweat in our bodies\r\n      to try to earn favor with God, but let us not forget that our toil has\r\n      been inherited to us from our ancestors through their disobedience and\r\n      punishment from God:<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Genesis 3'\">\r\n        Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from\r\n        the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat from\r\n        it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All\r\n        the days of your life.

He sits down at\r\n      a gambling table to gamble. At first, he bets only a little of what he\r\n      owns. He rolls the dice and a miracle happens! All the dice line up. The\r\n      man yells, 'Today is my lucky day. I will bet more!' So he rolls again but\r\n      with more of his possessions on the table. A miracle happens again! The\r\n      dice all line up. The man continues this over and over many times;\r\n      eventually, he has everything he owns on the table even the shirt off his\r\n      back. He thinks to himself, 'Surely I have rolled these dice over and\r\n      over, and they haven't failed me!' The man began to trust in his dice;\r\n      however, the dealer of the dice sees the man and thinks to himself, 'You\r\n      fool! One day these dice will not line up and everything you have will be\r\n      mine. For I have worked a long time in this pub and I see it happen over\r\n      and over. All dice will someday not line up.' Then the day came when the\r\n      dice did not line up as expected and everything on the table was taken\r\n      from the man. Then because the man didn't have enough money for even a\r\n      beer, he was cast out of the pub into darkness where he wept because\r\n      everything he had trusted in failed him.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ecclesiastes 5'\">\r\n        He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves\r\n        wealth with his income; this also is vanity. When goods increase, they\r\n        increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see\r\n        them with his eyes? Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats\r\n        little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.\r\n        There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were\r\n        kept by their owner to his hurt, and those riches were lost in a bad\r\n        venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. As\r\n        he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and\r\n        shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. This\r\n        also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain\r\n        is there to him who toils for the wind? Moreover, all his days he eats\r\n        in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Look around: point to something that you can take with you when you leave\r\n      the earth; not even your own body will go with you. In the beginning, we\r\n      were created from the dust of the earth; in the end, we will return to the\r\n      dust. In the beginning, our spirits were breathed into our bodies from God\r\n      and we became living souls; in the end, our spirits will return to God who\r\n      gave our spirits. When we return to Him, it will be as if only a moment\r\n      has passed to Him, but a lifetime for us. What then should we do with our\r\n      riches, that which we do not need but is excess?

Then, a day came when his tent was taken down, and he went\r\n      to his permanent home. The tent was destroyed and the man went to his\r\n      permanent home where he rejoiced and spent the rest of his days forever.\r\n      The meaning: we have this life but it is not ours to keep because we will\r\n      die one day; our lives are borrowed which is seen in the fact that we will\r\n      die. Since we will die, we look forward to our next life, our permanent\r\n      home, living worthy for eternal life which is the second life. There also\r\n      is a death after death which is the second death in which those whose\r\n      names are not written in the Book of Life will have their share.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ecclesiastes 3'\">\r\n        I concluded that God is testing us, to show us that we are no better\r\n        than animals.

A human being is no better off than an animal, because life\r\n        has no meaning for either. They are both going to the same place — the\r\n        dust. They both came from it; they will both go back to it. How can\r\n        anyone be sure that the human spirit goes upwards while an animal's\r\n        spirit goes down into the ground? </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ecclesiastes 9'\">\r\n        Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is\r\n        in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead. But\r\n        he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is\r\n        better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die, but the\r\n        dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for the memory of them\r\n        is forgotten.

Why? Because the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Every\r\n      year we make a new year's resolution; we say, 'This year will be nothing\r\n      like the last!'. We do well for the first few months, whatever our\r\n      resolution is, but the time comes when we inevitably go back to our old\r\n      ways. So you see, in our minds we want to do good, but in our flesh we\r\n      cannot; we have good intentions, but the power of our desires carry us\r\n      away and lead us astray. If we did everything we wanted to do every new\r\n      year, we would be made more perfect as time goes on; but, in fact, as time\r\n      goes on, the more sin we store up in our account. We are all in a great\r\n      debt and God's anger burns against our sin, for He Himself is a consuming\r\n      fire. So far, if you have been reading from the beginning, things have\r\n      been a little one sided. Please continue to bear with me and continue\r\n      reading.

He does not share His glory with another and He never changes: His\r\n      glory is in Him. He is now, was from the beginning, and is yet to come. In\r\n      all creation, God compares Himself to a consuming fire, and He ought to be\r\n      feared and revered. In fact, this is fear for God: to hate evil.

In another\r\n      example, if a father has a child and the child continually plays with\r\n      dangerous things like snakes and knives, the father will discipline the\r\n      child and start to hate the snakes and knives which cause his child harm.\r\n      Is the discipline done because the father hates the child? Of course not!\r\n      In fact, the discipline is proof that the father loves his child and the\r\n      father considers the child his own. If the father did not discipline the\r\n      child, that would mean the child is illegitimate or a bastard or unloved;\r\n      every father disciplines their child. So you see, the father's hatred is\r\n      directed towards the things that cause his child harm because he loves\r\n      him. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Exodus 34'\">\r\n        for you shall worship no other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous,\r\n        is a jealous God\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg15\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"filler\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-dark\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">He Sees and Hears</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      God is living, being the Creator of all living things, and sees the\r\n      thoughts and intentions of every human heart, even when we ourselves do\r\n      not know our own motives or intentions.

If we were good, then we wouldn't need to\r\n      be taught good; therefore it is true that we inherently know evil. We\r\n      inherit evil from the first man, Adam. In the garden, he sinned against\r\n      God by eating the forbidden fruit and listened to his wife Eve who was\r\n      deceived by the devil; so, since one man sinned one time, all people\r\n      became sinners since everyone comes from him; also, everyone dies because\r\n      of sin. As a child we were taught good, but we already know evil - that\r\n      which is evil we don't need to learn, but that which is good we need to\r\n      learn. This is our nature; it's effortless for us to do bad and takes all\r\n      our energy to do good and resist evil. If we grow old and are not taught\r\n      good, our parents are blamed. But why? People say, 'I blame the parents\r\n      for the child's behavior' or 'Why didn't his parents teach him what is\r\n      right?'. Therefore, we testify to ourselves about the way we are: evil.\r\n      Even more we say, 'I am only human' this we say when we do wrong or fall\r\n      short. This confirms to ourselves and to others that we belong to a nature\r\n      that is fallen and broken. It is our nature just as it's an eagle's nature\r\n      to fly or a penguin's nature not to fly. We are sinful (Note the period).\r\n      If anyone claims they are not sinful, they show how sinful they really\r\n      are, because they lie in regard to an obvious fact and seek to deceive.\r\n      This sinful nature is childish and like an animal: instinctual, brash,\r\n      self-centered, following after our own desires instead of God's Spirit.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Psalm 51'\">\r\n        Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived\r\n        me.

It is a good thing to judge evil or a lie: that's called justice.

When we deserved punishment and wrath, He\r\n      instead gave us His Son, born of a woman and in likeness of human flesh,\r\n      like we sinners have, to put to death sin in the flesh. Mercy triumphs\r\n      over judgement. He has all authority and power over the spiritual realm;\r\n      all the spiritual forces that wage war against us, Jesus defeated on the\r\n      Cross and then gave us right standing with God. When He was put on the\r\n      Cross to die, He was made a public spectacle by the world; but through the\r\n      Cross, He made a public spectacle of the powers and authorities that\r\n      govern this world, disarming them and triumphing over them by the cross.\r\n      He has nullified all power sin has which is in punishment and death\r\n      because He Himself, took our punishment and died for many.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      Through Jesus' shed blood and broken body, God righteously judged sin;\r\n      Jesus took the punishment that we deserve to free us from the power of\r\n      sin. God's law requires that we die for our sins; but Jesus Christ died in\r\n      our place. Through God's holy law, we stored up God's wrath for the day of\r\n      judgement; But through Jesus Christ, we have all been freely forgiven of\r\n      all our sins. We have all been called according to God's wonderful grace\r\n      which is by Christ Jesus. Since we are made right with God through what\r\n      Jesus did for us, no one can boast in the presence of God or in the\r\n      presence of men since we have all been made right with God by grace\r\n      through our Lord, the suffering Servant; if we do boast, we boast about\r\n      our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ who gave up His life for us because of\r\n      His great love. His love for us is shown to be great such that He took\r\n      upon the shame of our sin which He despised but endured through it because\r\n      He was looking forward to us being made right with God; Jesus was sinless,\r\n      but became sin to rescue us from sin; He was clean, but became dirty to\r\n      make us clean who were dirty.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      Too good to be true? Well now, you are beginning to know God for He is\r\n      Good, and He is True. It is impossible for God to lie and not a bad\r\n      thought crosses His mind. There is no sin that can now separate us from\r\n      crying out to God because it has been dealt with through Jesus Christ. All\r\n      have been called by grace through faith in the name of Jesus. His Blood\r\n      cries out for forgiveness instead of vengeance as did the blood of Abel\r\n      (Genesis 4). Nothing can now separate us from the love of God that is in\r\n      Christ Jesus our Lord. Hallelujah!

He was despised\r\n        and abandoned by men, A man of great pain and familiar with sickness;\r\n        And like one from whom people hide their faces, He was despised, and we\r\n        had no regard for Him. However, it was our sicknesses that He Himself\r\n        bore, And our pains that He carried; Yet we ourselves assumed that He\r\n        had been afflicted, Struck down by God, and humiliated. But He was\r\n        pierced for our offenses, He was crushed for our wrongdoings; The\r\n        punishment for our well-being was laid upon Him, And by His wounds we\r\n        are healed. All of us, like sheep, have gone astray, Each of us has\r\n        turned to his own way; But the Lord has caused the wrongdoing of us all\r\n        To fall on Him. He was oppressed and afflicted, Yet He did not open His\r\n        mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is\r\n        silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth. By oppression\r\n        and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who\r\n        considered That He was cut off from the land of the living For the\r\n        wrongdoing of my people, to whom the blow was due? And His grave was\r\n        assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death,\r\n        Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.\r\n        But the Lord desired To crush Him, causing Him grief; If He renders\r\n        Himself as a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will prolong\r\n        His days, And the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in His hand. As\r\n        a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be satisfied; By\r\n        His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, For\r\n        He will bear their wrongdoings. Therefore, I will allot Him a portion\r\n        with the great, And He will divide the plunder with the strong, Because\r\n        He poured out His life unto death, And was counted with wrongdoers; Yet\r\n        He Himself bore the sin of many, And interceded for the wrongdoers.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg21\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"filler-light\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Jesus, the Rock of our Salvation</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Exodus 17'\">\r\n        They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our\r\n        children and livestock die of thirst?” Then Moses cried out to the Lord,\r\n        “What am I to do with these people?

God elsewhere said,\r\n      \"I will make you like God to the people of Egypt\". So, in the people's\r\n      stony hearts, was revealed the contents of their hearts by desiring to\r\n      physically stone Moses; the anger in their stony hearts was expressed with\r\n      actual stones. Moses was God's mouth-piece, He spoke on behalf of God, so\r\n      the people's anger was actually directed towards God, not Moses; so the\r\n      people were angry with God. God could have given the people what they\r\n      deserved but instead of striking the rock of the people's hearts and\r\n      wounding them, God struck a different Rock, a spiritual Rock, which was\r\n      Christ; and out of that Rock came water for the people to drink. By God's\r\n      grace, they were spared but the Rock was struck instead. A spiritual drink\r\n      came from that rock; it is spiritual because normally water doesn't come\r\n      from rocks; no, water doesn't come from rocks, but from springs and Jesus\r\n      didn't come from earth, but from heaven. The water He gives us is His\r\n      Spirit which wells up inside us Living Water. By that Water, we never\r\n      thirst again.

And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him.\r\n        For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual\r\n        immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit,\r\n        sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.

Moses disobeyed because he got angry with\r\n      the people and struck the rock again; he was then banished from entering\r\n      into the promise land because he did not honor God in front of all the\r\n      people. This serves as a warning for us today. Christ was sacrificed once\r\n      and for all, not many times. If we struggle with sin, let us talk to our\r\n      Rock and get deliverance from our sin, instead of striking Him again by\r\n      deliberately sinning. Let us not be content in our sin because it is sin\r\n      that Jesus saves us from; He has set us free to be free. Sin has lost its\r\n      power and has been rendered powerless. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 10'\">\r\n        If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge\r\n        of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful\r\n        expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies\r\n        of God. Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on\r\n        the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment, do\r\n        you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the\r\n        Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was\r\n        sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who\r\n        said, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, “The Lord will judge\r\n        his people.” It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living\r\n        God.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg7\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg7\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light floater\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Jesus, the Lamb of God</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      Under the Old Covenant, people were forgiven by God for their sins by\r\n      sacrificing an animal. When they sinned, blood needed to be shed for\r\n      forgiveness: the animal had to be perfect; the animal also had to be a\r\n      clean animal; the animal had to be innocent of all wrong (yes, animals can\r\n      do wrong too like goring humans, etc). With sin comes death, because sin\r\n      and death walk hand-in-hand, they are friends, just as righteousness and\r\n      life are friends. All of the sacrifices the Israelites gave were for\r\n      unintentional sin: sins done in weakness or ignorance. There was no\r\n      sacrifice for intentional, willful, deliberate, rebellious sin. So the\r\n      Israelites had to sacrifice a lamb to be forgiven for their sin. The\r\n      sacrifice did not clear the offerer's conscience however, because they\r\n      still had guilt because the innocent animal had to die and take their\r\n      place. The animal was the offerer's substitute. Likewise, Jesus, the Lamb\r\n      of God, was sacrificed on our behalf as our substitute, for the\r\n      forgiveness of our sins, not a sacrifice that needed to be offered over\r\n      and over as was everytime an Israelite sinned, but once and for all.\r\n      What's more? We do not have guilt for our sin nor guilt because our sin\r\n      caused the innocent Christ to be slain. Why? Because He now lives -- and\r\n      forever; God raised Him from the dead! His one act of obedience is the\r\n      only work that matters in the sight of God; the only work that can forgive\r\n      sin and make many righteous; by His one act of obedience, dying on a\r\n      cross, all our sins are forgiven.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 9'\">\r\n        In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood,\r\n        and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 10'\">\r\n        And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the\r\n        same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But this Man, after He\r\n        had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand\r\n        of God, from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Before all this, when the Israelites were in slavery in Egypt (Book of\r\n      Exodus), they had to sacrifice a lamb and paint their doorpost with its\r\n      blood. The angel of death sent by God then came through the city and\r\n      slayed anyone whose doorpost was not marked with the lamb's blood -- the\r\n      death angel was commanded to passed over that house and not harm anyone\r\n      inside. This is now remembered by the Israelites, even to this day, as the\r\n      Passover. In the same way, Jesus was sacrificed, and we have been\r\n      sprinkled by His blood to purify our guilty consciences; we bear His blood\r\n      on us; we have been rescued from God's wrath. The second death has no\r\n      power over us who have put our trust in Jesus and remain until the end.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'John 1'\">\r\n        The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb\r\n        of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

In the beginning, water came out of the earth, not\r\n      from rain in the sky; so when Noah told them about this, the people\r\n      ignored him and thought he was crazy -- 'something like this has never\r\n      happened before' they thought, 'since the days of old, water has come from\r\n      the earth'. However, despite what they believed, flood waters did come\r\n      from the sky and God released the water from inside the earth to flood all\r\n      of the land. But everyone who entered in through the door of the arc were\r\n      saved. They were Noah and his family, 8 in all. Likewise today, whoever\r\n      enters in through the Door who is Jesus Christ will be saved from the\r\n      judgement that is coming upon the earth, not again by water, but this time\r\n      by fire. Through God's provision given by grace, He spares some who are\r\n      willing to believe and trust in Him.

And behold, a young lion came toward\r\n        him roaring. Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and although\r\n        he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a\r\n        young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had\r\n        done. Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in\r\n        Samson's eyes. After some days he returned to take her. And he turned\r\n        aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of\r\n        bees in the body of the lion, and honey. He scraped it out into his\r\n        hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and\r\n        mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them\r\n        that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion. (...) Out of\r\n        the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      A lion is strong and powerful; no one takes a lion and brings it in their\r\n      home so their children can play with it; they don't because the lion is\r\n      dangerous. A lion typically isn't sweet -- it won't let you pet it and it\r\n      won't give you any kisses! Likewise, Jesus Christ is mighty and powerful\r\n      being the Son of God; He is called the Lion from the Tribe of Judah; He\r\n      came down into this world and died a criminal's death in our places\r\n      although He was no criminal, so we would be made right with God. His life\r\n      was not taken from Him, but He laid it down. Before He was captured He\r\n      said, \"do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will\r\n      provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels? How then could the\r\n      Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?” (Matthew 26). Just\r\n      like the dead lion Samson came across, from Jesus' death comes something\r\n      sweet -- forgiveness of sins and justification with God. Although He is as\r\n      a lion, He is as a lamb, One who takes away the sin of the world; He\r\n      became what we are (sin), so that we would become what He is (righteous).\r\n      This is the free gift of God: everlasting life through Jesus Christ our\r\n      Lord.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Revelation 5'\">\r\n        Then one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep!

In the same way, Jesus took upon Himself all of our sin and took it\r\n      to a place outside the camp where He was crucified. Our sins can only be\r\n      forgiven when we own them; how can we be forgiven of something if we claim\r\n      we have not done it, or we claim it does not belong to us? We confess our\r\n      sins, and He is faithful to forgive us of our sins; He has proven our\r\n      forgiveness by His Son. If we are guilty, and we do not confess our sins,\r\n      we make Him out to be a liar, claiming we have not sinned. When we claim\r\n      to not have sinned, there cannot be forgiveness because we do not own our\r\n      sin. How can we be forgiven of sin that is not ours that we reject it\r\n      belongs to us? Therefore, let us confess to God when we have guilt and our\r\n      sins will be forgiven. God has promised this to us and it is impossible\r\n      for God to lie; His promises are sure. We will know we are forgiven\r\n      because our guilt will be removed; our consciences will no longer condemn\r\n      us. Jesus took upon Himself our guilt and shame and blame.

So the people came to Moses\r\n        and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and\r\n        against you; intercede with the Lord, that He will remove the serpents\r\n        from us.” And Moses interceded for the people. Then the Lord said to\r\n        Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and put it on a flag pole; and it shall\r\n        come about, that everyone who is bitten, and looks at it, will live.” So\r\n        Moses made a bronze serpent and put it on the flag pole; and it came\r\n        about, that if a serpent bit someone, and he looked at the bronze\r\n        serpent, he lived. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'John 3'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, the Son of Man must\r\n        also be lifted up. So that everyone who believes can have eternal life\r\n        in him. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      God first sent fiery serpents to punish the people for their sins; then\r\n      gave them provision by grace so that they could be saved; God did not\r\n      remove the serpents like the people asked, but opened up a way by grace\r\n      through the people's faith; it's through faith since they had to look at\r\n      the serpent and believe they would be saved by doing so. The serpent was\r\n      made of bronze and so was the alter in the courtyard of God's tent,\r\n      showing that it's through sacrifice we can enter into God's tent: namely,\r\n      the sacrifice of Christ. Note that God saved the Israelites from the venom\r\n      of the serpents through the bronze image of the same serpent, and that\r\n      image is dead, but they had to hope and believe it would give life. God\r\n      commanded the people not to make an image, but commanded Moses to make an\r\n      image of the serpent. Likewise, God saves us from the sting of death\r\n      through the perfect image of Himself, Jesus, and Him who bears our sin,\r\n      suffering and death. We may be fearful to look at Him because of our sin\r\n      and God's wrath toward sin, but we must believe and trust God that if we\r\n      look upon Jesus crucified, we will be saved from death, and we will live.\r\n      Obviously everyone dies, but He who looks at Jesus and believes, when he\r\n      dies he sleeps because he is alive to God even while he is dead and will\r\n      be raised up on the last day.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Genesis 45'\">\r\n        And he said, “I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And\r\n        now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me\r\n        here, for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the famine has\r\n        been in the land these two years, and there are yet five years in which\r\n        there will be neither plowing nor harvest. And God sent me before you to\r\n        preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many\r\n        survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      How can we see Jesus lifted up on a cross? Paul mentioned in one of his\r\n      letters, \"For the meaning of Jesus Christ's death was made as clear to you\r\n      as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross.\" (Galatians 3) We\r\n      see Him crucified through faith; faith is seeing without physically\r\n      seeing. Watching a movie or seeing an image with your eyes is not faith,\r\n      but actually destroys the faith of those who see such images. True faith\r\n      is seeing without seeing; the conviction of things unseen; the assurance\r\n      of things hoped for.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg8\" id=\"call-faith\">\r\n  <div class=\"lighttext\" [@simpleFadeAnimation]>\r\n    <span class=\"border\"> The Call - Faith </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg8\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light floater\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Running the Race of Faith</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Corinthians 9'\">\r\n        Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one\r\n        receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete\r\n        exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable\r\n        wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box\r\n        as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under\r\n        control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'2 Timothy 2, 4'\">\r\n        Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the\r\n        victorʼs crown except by competing according to the rules. (...) I have\r\n        finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me\r\n        the crown of righteousness </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Galatians 2, 5'\">\r\n        I wanted to be sure I was not running and had not been running my race\r\n        in vain. You were running a good race. (...) Who cut in on you to keep\r\n        you from obeying the truth? </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      No one runs a race for a prize without first training: they strip off\r\n      every weight that slows them down so that they will win; they learn the\r\n      rules and know what exactly they can and cannot do. Runners are\r\n      disciplined in what goes in their body, and they have strict schedules for\r\n      training. No one runs the race to get second place, but first place,\r\n      otherwise all the training and running would have been in vain. They also\r\n      learn endurance through their suffering and harsh treatment of the body.\r\n      This is used as an illustration of the race which we run: the true race\r\n      that is run by living a life of faith in Jesus Christ. Disciple literally\r\n      means \"disciplined one\" and we are called disciples of Christ;\r\n      self-discipline is given to us by the Holy Spirit. We run the race of\r\n      faith not for a perishable crown, but for an indestructible crown of life.\r\n      Running implies you have a place to go and in the context of a race it's\r\n      the finish line; it also implies hard work. The world we live in wants us\r\n      to always be busy and rushing, but where are we rushing to? Out of the\r\n      context of a race, we are running in vain, rushing to our death; but if we\r\n      rush in faith in Jesus Christ, we run to life. So run! And to win! The\r\n      race of faith is also the good fight; we fight with our words of truth,\r\n      seasoned with salt, preserving the Truth of God and His grace breaking\r\n      down every stronghold and bringing it into subjection to the Truth.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 12'\">\r\n        Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily\r\n        entangles.

In Christ Jesus, we have\r\n      been set free from the law for righteousness and have been made right by\r\n      Jesus Christ. The law stood and condemned us: the longer we lived, the\r\n      more we sinned, the greater our debt. However, through Christ Jesus, He\r\n      has freely forgiven the ticket of debt of our transgressions that was\r\n      against us, having nailed it to the cross, along with all the rules and\r\n      regulations that do not help us to live a righteous life. No-one can obey\r\n      all of these laws perfectly; and no-one always does right and never sins;\r\n      Jesus Christ is our righteousness ; He obeyed the law perfectly and became\r\n      the new law Giver: the Law of Christ which is through faith in His name.\r\n      We are free from the law of God because we follow the law of the Spirit\r\n      and life; the fruit of the Spirit are all good things and there is no law\r\n      against good things! The law was given by God to convict us of sin and to\r\n      store up transgressions into our account so that through Christ Jesus, He\r\n      could freely forgive us of our rebellion to that law. The law also acted\r\n      as a guardian until the time of Christ was revealed. To illustrate this:\r\n      we all in America are usually under our parent's supervision until the age\r\n      of 18. When we turn 18, we are free to go out from under their\r\n      guardianship. Likewise, we have been locked up and chained under the power\r\n      and supervision of these elemental spiritual rulers and authorities until\r\n      the fullness of time, when we were set free in Christ by the freedom of\r\n      doing what is right, good and just, having been made new by the Spirit.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Timothy 1'\">\r\n        But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, knowing this:\r\n        that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and\r\n        insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and\r\n        profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for\r\n        manslayers, for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars,\r\n        for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound\r\n        doctrine, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was\r\n        committed to my trust. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Therefore, since we have been free'd from the law (and where there is an\r\n      absence of law, there cannot be any transgression since sin has it's power\r\n      in the law), we can serve God in the freedom of grace. We have died to the\r\n      law when we were united in the death of Christ through our faith and\r\n      change of mind; and those who have died are free'd from the law (Romans\r\n      7). We are no longer under law, but grace; and sin is no longer our\r\n      master, but Christ. If we sin, we offer ourselves as obedient servants to\r\n      sin and get entangled once again in it which is hostile to God who gives\r\n      us His Holy Spirit. Christ has set us free so that we would be free;\r\n      therefore, deny what is earthly within you and daily strive to maintain a\r\n      clear conscience before God and man (from which we have not been free'd\r\n      from), looking heavenward to Christ Jesus who cleansed us from our defiled\r\n      conscience . So we see now, that faith and a clear conscience go\r\n      hand-in-hand because they are friends; do not separate those who are true\r\n      friends.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 14'\">\r\n        But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is\r\n        not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      We must know that the law of Christ is weightier than the law of God and\r\n      if we do the law of Christ, we do the law of God. We have been set free\r\n      from the law of God, but are now under the law of Christ, which is through\r\n      faith. The rationale to every commandment of Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ;\r\n      He is the reason why; He is the Rationale; He is the reason we love --\r\n      love fulfills the entirety of the law. We can see in Matthew 5, the\r\n      fulfillment of the law of God and the great expectation of the law of\r\n      Christ: \"You have heard that it was said...\" (I highly suggest you read\r\n      for yourself the chapter and learn from the Lord). <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Corinthians 9'\">\r\n        To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being\r\n        outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win\r\n        those outside the law.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg9\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg9\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light floater\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Abide in Him and He in us</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      God gave food guidelines to His people: only eat animals with split hoof\r\n      and chews the cud, fish with fins and scales, etc. But later, after\r\n      Christ, all foods are considered clean to eat. But why? Three reasons:\r\n      firstly, we are considered holy and set apart, even in regard to the type\r\n      of food we eat: whether we eat or drink we do it for the Lord. Secondly,\r\n      some people act like these animals which God declares unclean; we are to\r\n      stay away from any person who claims Christ and is greedy like a dog has\r\n      no sense returning to its vomit; or is vile like a pig, rolling around\r\n      delighting in the mud after being cleansed; or a bottom feeder like some\r\n      fish, living in the depths of darkness eating unforsaken shameful things;\r\n      or a scavenger like a vulture, waiting for someone to do all the hard work\r\n      so it can swoop down and steal. Yes, stay away from such people who act\r\n      like these unclean animals: bad company corrupts good character and sin\r\n      destroys much that is good. Thirdly, we eat words through our ears, you\r\n      could say, and we should cry out for pure spiritual milk like newborn\r\n      babies; the milk is the Word of God in its purity: the Gospel of Christ.\r\n      The Word of God is our food, and we do not live by bread alone but by\r\n      every word that comes from the mouth of God. What our hearts are full of\r\n      will come out of our mouth and what we put into our heart comes from what\r\n      we put in through our eyes and ears; therefore, we ought to be watchful\r\n      what we eat as God teaches us in regard with food. The same people who\r\n      live like unclean animals also eat unclean things: the things they eat are\r\n      the false teachings they bring with them, deceiving many. God warns us\r\n      about them, but we listen to His voice and not that of a stranger.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 12'\">\r\n        Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its\r\n        fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. You brood of\r\n        vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks\r\n        what the heart is full of. A good man brings good things out of the good\r\n        stored up in him, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil\r\n        stored up in him. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Jesus Christ is the Word of God -- He is who we eat and drink. During\r\n      communion, we remember Him by physically eating bread which represents His\r\n      body broken for us; and we remember Him by physically drinking the blood\r\n      of grapes which represents His blood poured out for us. When we do this,\r\n      we proclaim the Lord's death until He comes and proclaim our unity with\r\n      all of God's children who partake in the same spiritual food and drink. We\r\n      are united in Christ as the one loaf is broken and consumed by all who are\r\n      partaking in the Lord's supper; the one loaf is inside many of us as His\r\n      one Spirit is inside many of us, and we are one body as His one Body was\r\n      broken for His church, which is also called His Body and Bride: just as\r\n      Adam's bride was taken from his body, so is Christ's bride taken from His\r\n      body. If we abide in Him, we have a promise that He will abide in us. God\r\n      shows us we are not only strengthened by food, but by every Word that\r\n      comes from His mouth: the word of grace. Just as food works best when\r\n      we're hungry: God's grace works best in weakness; we are strengthened in\r\n      our hearts by His grace. Also, if we abide in Him, we will bear much fruit\r\n      because He is in us; apart from Him, we can do nothing. Learn the key to\r\n      abiding, which is staying rooted in Christ, praying always in the Spirit,\r\n      firmly planted in the Word that has the power to save us if we hold firm\r\n      until the end.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'John 6'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of\r\n        the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.

Why not? Because they pursued it not by\r\n        faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling\r\n        stone. As it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people\r\n        to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in\r\n        him will never be put to shame.” </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      It's a great offense to say: those who work hard to attain righteousness\r\n      WILL NOT receive it but those who do not work to attain righteousness WILL\r\n      receive it. The work that does not receive righteousness is by the efforts\r\n      of obeying the Law by the sweat of our own brow; our sweat was given to us\r\n      as punishment by God and can't earn us favor with God: human flesh\r\n      accomplishes nothing for God -- it never pleased God and never will. But\r\n      the work that does please God, is actually not really a work at all: it's\r\n      of faith. So then, where is there room for boasting?<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Jeremiah 9'\">\r\n        But let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows Me,\r\n        that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and\r\n        righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the\r\n        LORD. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      All the way from the beginning of time, God had hidden by mystery in His\r\n      Word the way to be made right with Himself, which is now revealed in\r\n      Christ -- a righteousness which is through faith. Jesus came down from\r\n      heaven onto earth and healed and did good; the people who received healing\r\n      were those who had FAITH in His name. Abraham was considered righteous by\r\n      believing in God's promise which was given by God's generosity. Today it\r\n      is the same: we are made right with God by believing the testimony about\r\n      His Son: God has freely given us right standing with Himself and eternal\r\n      life by the name of His Son. After Abraham was counted as righteous by\r\n      God, He gave Abraham a sign of the covenant which was the circumcision of\r\n      all males. Today, we have the same sign, but it's a spiritual\r\n      circumcision, a procedure of putting away the body of sins of flesh and\r\n      taking out the heart of stone: God puts away the flesh of the body and\r\n      takes away the hardness of the heart -- the only good flesh is the heart\r\n      of flesh. God is the Physician, and He does this procedure; it happens at\r\n      the moment we have believed the testimony He has given concerning His Son;\r\n      the second part of the procedure, is the uniting of His Holy Spirit with\r\n      our spirit.

When you believed, you were marked\r\n        in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, Who is a deposit\r\n        guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s\r\n        possession—to the praise of His glory. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      The Holy Spirit has many names and titles, for example: the Helper, the\r\n      Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of Grace, the Spirit of Holiness. He\r\n      intertwines with our spirit and unites with us, making our bodies into\r\n      Temples with God's presence living inside: He makes us holy by His\r\n      glorious presence. The Holy Spirit leads us into all truth and searches\r\n      out the mysteries of God in the Scriptures so that we may obtain all that\r\n      is ours freely in Christ Jesus, also convicting the world of\r\n      righteousness, sin and judgement, testifying to Jesus Christ the Messiah\r\n      in all boldness -- the Holy Spirit is indeed the Spirit of Jesus. We now\r\n      follow Christ by following the inward compulsion of the Spirit because\r\n      Jesus is now seated at the right hand of the Father and is no longer\r\n      walking with us.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      We already talked about our race which is a run in faith, but there is\r\n      also a walk, walking after the Holy Spirit, following Him as He goes ahead\r\n      of us; we do not need to be afraid since God goes ahead of us and paves\r\n      the way for us: we are greatly comforted by this as was Moses when the\r\n      Israelites went into the promised land, God said, \"I will send My angel\r\n      ahead of you\" (Exodus 23). The walk is defined in many ways: walk in the\r\n      Spirit, walk in love, walk by faith, walk in the light, walk in the truth.\r\n      If we walk in the Spirit we have no obligation to walk according to the\r\n      flesh, gratifying its desires; these two, the flesh and the Spirit, are\r\n      contrary to one another and constantly war within us, so we are not free\r\n      to carry out our good intentions. We do not need to be told what is true,\r\n      because the Holy Spirit testifies to us what is true, and He is the Spirit\r\n      of Truth; so then, we know the difference between truth and lies because\r\n      of the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from the dead. He turns these\r\n      ordinary bodies of ours into Temples of the Living God; our bodies are\r\n      fragile clay jars with special treasure inside.\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 16'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\"\r\n        >He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter replied,\r\n        “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him,\r\n        “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah!

Jesus gave\r\n      up His Ghost on the cross to pour out His Ghost at Pentecost; however, it\r\n      is necessary for our hearts and bodies to be made pure before the Spirit\r\n      comes: conscience sprinkled with Christ's blood, heart circumcised from\r\n      its hardness and deceitfulness, and our bodies washed with the pure water\r\n      of the Word. There are differences in when people receive the Spirit; in\r\n      the book of Acts, many of these cases are outlined, but in short: Jews\r\n      receive justification by faith and the Gentiles through faith (Romans 3).\r\n      All however, must be born of water and of Spirit: being born of water is\r\n      John's baptism which calls for confession and repentance; being born of\r\n      spirit is Jesus' baptism which calls for faith in Jesus Christ (God\r\n      raising Him from the dead and exalting Him at His right hand). We must be\r\n      born of both water and Spirit. If someone has a moral standard already, as\r\n      did the Jews, they only need to believe in Christ and receive the baptism\r\n      of the Spirit: Acts 2 & Acts 10 are two examples of this.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Corinthians 12'\">\r\n        For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or\r\n        Greeks, whether slaves or free persons, and all were made to drink one\r\n        Spirit.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg23\" id=\"our-response\">\r\n  <div class=\"lighttext\" [@simpleFadeAnimation]>\r\n    <span class=\"border\"> Our Response </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"filler-light\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Repentence from Dead Things</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Galatians 2'\">\r\n        I have been crucified with Christ.

I do not\r\n        nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law,\r\n        then Christ died for no purpose. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Sin is the opposite of doing the will of God; it's God's will that we\r\n      would love one another as Christ has loved us. When we love, we obey the\r\n      commandments of God because the entirety of the law is summed up in this\r\n      one command: love your neighbor as yourself. All sin has to do with\r\n      selfishness; however, Love is not self-seeking, but self-sacrificing,\r\n      self-serving, and self-suffering: the three S's to love in truth.\r\n      Therefore, we ought to love on another as Christ sacrificed Himself in\r\n      love for us. Our new heart and Spirit will lead us away from all\r\n      worldliness and carnality and towards a holy and righteous God. Without\r\n      leaving sin, we cannot get near to God (this world and God's Kingdom are\r\n      on completely opposite spectrum, in the world there is sin and in God\r\n      there is righteousness) To know whether or not you are walking in love,\r\n      read 1 John, the letter of discernment. In love there is life; in sin\r\n      there is death. If you want to know what sin looks like, look at death;\r\n      sin is death. It is necessary for us to die to sin as Christ died to sin;\r\n      He did not die for His own sin, because He had none, but our sin; so, we\r\n      must put to death what is deathly within us, then we will truly live! We\r\n      will also have confidence on the day of the Lord, and the second death\r\n      will have no power over us, because we have died to ourselves here on\r\n      earth and lived as Jesus lived.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 6'\">\r\n        What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may\r\n        increase? By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we\r\n        live in it any longer? (...) In the same way, count yourselves dead to\r\n        sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in\r\n        your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. Do not offer any\r\n        part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer\r\n        yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and\r\n        offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.\r\n        For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the\r\n        law, but under grace. (...) What then? Shall we sin because we are not\r\n        under the law but under grace? By no means! Don’t you know that when you\r\n        offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the\r\n        one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to\r\n        obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that,\r\n        though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your\r\n        heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 16'\">\r\n        If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up\r\n        his cross, and follow Me.

Jesus in\r\n      John 12 states, \"He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his\r\n      life in this world will keep it for eternal life.\" and in Revelation 12,\r\n      \"And they have conquered him (the devil) by the blood of the Lamb and by\r\n      the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto\r\n      death.\" This is one way how we produce fruit unto God: in keeping with\r\n      repentance (Matthew 3). Faith expresses itself through love; and love is\r\n      not only for one's self, but for God and others; and we love the Father\r\n      because He first loved us. If we have love for the Father, we also love\r\n      His Son; and if we love the Son, we will obey His commandments (not\r\n      heaping sin on Him and doing what's right); and if we obey His\r\n      commandments, we are known by Him; and if we are known by Him, He will\r\n      never say to us, \"I never knew you. Away from Me, you evildoers!\" because\r\n      Paul said, \"But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him\" (1 Corinthians\r\n      8); and in the end, it's not if we know the Lord, but if the Lord knows\r\n      us:\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 7'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of\r\n        heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in\r\n        heaven.

For the promise is for you and for\r\n        your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord\r\n        our God calls to himself. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 6'\">\r\n        Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in\r\n        order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of\r\n        the Father, so also we may live a new way of life. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      We're only eligible for baptism when we know that we are dead to sin: do\r\n      people bury the living or the dead? Baptism is burial; and into Jesus'\r\n      death and His death was to sin, not His own sin, but for our sin. And\r\n      since He died to our sin, we ought to die to our sin as He did. Now, the\r\n      life He lives is to God, alive from the dead; and after baptism, we\r\n      consider ourselves alive from the dead to God because we were dead but\r\n      have been forgiven. So those who are to be buried are those who know they\r\n      are dead to sin. In the old covenant, priests were not allowed to get near\r\n      a dead body lest they defile themselves: the dead buried their own dead.\r\n      In the new covenant, priests (we are a royal priesthood) bury the dead:\r\n      the living bury the dead. Therefore, after you have changed your mind\r\n      about sin, confessing and forsaking, be baptized by someone who is living,\r\n      calling on the name of the Lord, and your new life will begin out of the\r\n      water as alive to God, by the power of His might. Our conscience has been\r\n      dirtied by the world and sin, so baptism is an appeal to God for a clear\r\n      conscience by the washing away of our sins. Baptism is the bridge from old\r\n      life into new life; everything of the old life is washed away and the new\r\n      life begins.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Acts 22'\">\r\n        And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your\r\n        sins, calling on the name of the Lord </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      When we are tempted (and he will be) we are to resist temptation and the\r\n      tempter, the devil, by the fact that we have died with Christ, and we\r\n      point to our baptism as proof of the fact of our burial: Ecclesiastes 7\r\n      says, \"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death\r\n      better than the day of birth\". God has given us tangible reminders of such\r\n      spiritual truths, so let us not forget: baptism reminds us of our death\r\n      and burial, bread and wine reminds us of the Lord's broken body and blood,\r\n      and not to mention all the parables -- they describe spiritual truths\r\n      using physical things. Baptism is effective because of the resurrection of\r\n      Jesus Christ; and we are made righteous by believing God raised Jesus from\r\n      the dead (Romans 10); and our forgiveness from sins and faith has purpose\r\n      because of His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15). Why is it so? Because if\r\n      Jesus did not raise, we are still guilty of sin: blood is still on our\r\n      hands and we have guilt because of it; but because Jesus rose from the\r\n      dead, so all guilt is removed because He is alive: can someone be\r\n      convicted of murder if the victim is still living? Another way to show the\r\n      same thing: if we die and are buried, how can we come back to life if\r\n      there is no resurrection? In that case, we have died in vain!\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Peter 3'\">\r\n        There is also an antitype which now saves us—baptism (not the removal of\r\n        the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God),\r\n        through the resurrection of Jesus Christ </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Corinthians 15'\">\r\n        If these things (resurrection of the dead) are not so, what will those\r\n        do who are baptized for the dead?

By default, we all want to gravitate back towards\r\n      what we already know: sin; but we have died to sin, so how can we go back\r\n      to it? Therefore, we move forward towards faith in God. We are not called\r\n      to repent and obey the Law, which consists of 613 commandments; we are\r\n      called to repent and <i>believe</i>. Only through faith can we obey God's\r\n      law; and any lack of obedience to God's law reveals a lack of truth or\r\n      faith in the truth, as Jesus says:\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'John 8'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        If you abide in My word, you are truly My disciples, and you will know\r\n        the truth, and the truth will set you free </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      We cannot serve two masters: we will hate the one and love the other; we\r\n      cannot be half in or half out or lukewarm or grey. If we have any love for\r\n      the world in us, the love of the Father is not in us (1 John 2); and if we\r\n      make ourselves a friend with the world, we make ourselves an enemy of God\r\n      (James 4); and let us remember, Jesus said, \"I have come to cast fire upon\r\n      the earth; and how I wish it were already kindled!\" (Luke 12) and later,\r\n      \"What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.\" (Luke 16); and\r\n      finally, the beast out of the water (Rev 13) had written on its head the\r\n      name of blasphemy against God. So we see by all this: the kingdom of\r\n      darkness, this world, whose rule is satan has nothing in common with the\r\n      Kingdom of Light whose ruler is Jesus Christ and God, His Father; so, we\r\n      die to the world and it's passions and lusts, as Paul said, \"But God\r\n      forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\n      by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.\"\r\n      (Galatians 6) and believe in the Living God who bought us with His Son,\r\n      Jesus Christ. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      Jesus died and was buried and rose from the dead, giving us right standing\r\n      with God the Father, having reconciled us to God and restoring fellowship\r\n      with Him through His earthly body: what God has done is the objective\r\n      fact, giving unto us freely by the grace of God right standing with\r\n      Himself. To receive this wonderful gift is through faith, conditionally,\r\n      being transferred from darkness to light and from the dominion of satan to\r\n      God, by the opening of our eyes to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, crossing\r\n      over from death to life through our baptism in His name. Not just by a\r\n      single instance of faith, as if it were <i>by</i> faith, but instead\r\n      <i>through</i> faith, a continual observance of the objective facts of\r\n      Jesus Christ given for us, remembering His sacrifice until the end of the\r\n      age or death, lest we have believed in vain. The disciple's walk is\r\n      continually in faith, from start to finish:\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 1'\">\r\n        For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as\r\n        it is written, “BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.”\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 12'\">\r\n        looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the\r\n        joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and\r\n        has sat down at the right hand of the throne of\r\n        God.</blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      Since faith is emphasized, does that mean we don't keep the law? No: it's\r\n      only when we have truly do have faith, we observe the law; the whole of\r\n      the law is summed up in one command: \"Love your neighbor as yourself\"\r\n      (Galatians 5). And we love others because we abide in Christ's love. So\r\n      our obedience lies in staying in Christ, abiding in Him through faith,\r\n      trusting in His kindness -- otherwise, we will be cut off (Romans 11). Do\r\n      you now see God's ways? He gives us love to love our fellow believer and\r\n      neighbor; He blesses us to bless others (Genesis 12); He shines light on\r\n      us to become illuminated and a light (Ephesians 5). Without Him first\r\n      loving us, we cannot love a stranger. Thank God the answer is always in\r\n      Jesus Christ! Whatever we are lacking is found in Christ, Who has freely\r\n      given us the riches of His knowledge and wisdom and revelation and grace,\r\n      fully equipping us for every good work. So you now see, the truth sets us\r\n      free; and Jesus is the Truth; and Truth is worked in us and out of us\r\n      through love:\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Galatians 5'\">\r\n        For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means\r\n        anything, but faith working through love.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'John 13'\">\r\n        A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I\r\n        have loved you, you also are to love one another.

A command is\r\n      sometimes summed up in three sections: Prohibition, remedy and rationale.\r\n      The prohibition is what we should not do, remedy is what we should do\r\n      instead, and rationale is the reason why. The reason why for every command\r\n      is Christ; and this is also the way of faith: everything brings us back to\r\n      Christ because He is the Way. He is the example for us to follow as\r\n      obedient children, imitating the Father and learning from Him. We\r\n      shouldn't be led astray by mere human commands that have an appearance of\r\n      wisdom in promoting severe treatment of the body and asceticism, but are\r\n      of no use in stopping the indulgence of the flesh (Colossians 2); these\r\n      are not the way, but a dead end.

Also, since we have been reconciled to God\r\n      through faith in the Word, His Son, we see the power of words, especially\r\n      the Word of God which has the power to save. As the proverb says, \"Death\r\n      and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat\r\n      its fruit.\"\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'2 Corinthians 4'\">\r\n        having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I\r\n        BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,” we also believe, therefore we also speak\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      and\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Peter 3'\">\r\n        But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord.

We must confess His\r\n      name in sincerity, speaking of His righteous works and goodness and love:\r\n      as Christ called us according to His grace, we call to others and since\r\n      Christ is not ashamed to call us His brothers, we are not ashamed to call\r\n      Him our Lord. The very definition of preacher is one who cries out in\r\n      public; we do not all have the gift to be a street preacher, but we have\r\n      all been given Good News. Be always ready and looking forward to give\r\n      reason for your hope in Christ. People in the world always tell each other\r\n      about good restaurants and good movies and good games: how much more\r\n      should we with such great news? When we sell a car, we do so by telling\r\n      about the sweet and the bitter about the car, otherwise, when they see the\r\n      car and isn't what you made it out to be, they will not do business with\r\n      you because you are being dishonest. Likewise, we sell Christ in truth,\r\n      although Christ isn't sold but free, but one receives Him through faith.\r\n      By telling truth we show that our faith is true and living; a faith that\r\n      is not living is dead and a lie: in fact, a belief that has no merit in\r\n      reality is called a delusion. When we do not speak, it is because one or\r\n      two reasons: we shrink back in disbelief, or we don't love our neighbor.\r\n      God gives us a good example of the order of events we ought to follow in\r\n      regard to walking and speaking with integrity: study the Word, obey it,\r\n      then teach others. A hypocrite means actor: someone who puts on a mask to\r\n      play a different part in a different scene -- such a person loses his\r\n      identity by constantly deception, deceiving himself (1 John 1, James 1 &\r\n      3). We can be sincere and earnest with integrity in two different ways:\r\n      our word and our works; these two shouldn't contradict each other lest we\r\n      be found to be hypocritical.\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ezra 7'\">\r\n        Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, and to do it and to\r\n        teach his statutes and rules in Israel </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 13'\">\r\n        So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people\r\n        through his own blood.

The truth of this reality is found in many\r\n      instances in the Scriptures: there were only 8 that were saved, Noah and\r\n      his family, when the ancient world perished from a massive deluge that\r\n      covered the earth; and only Lot and his two daughters escaped from Sodom\r\n      which was burned, completely consumed, by raining sulfur because of its\r\n      wickedness; also, Caleb and Joshua were the only two men out of 600,000 to\r\n      enter into the promised land. We should work out what God has worked in us\r\n      with fear and trembling, knowing that the way truly is narrow. Jesus said,\r\n      \"However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?\" We\r\n      are not worthy to be a slave and untie the strap of His scandal or as\r\n      Abigail said, \"Here is your maidservant, a servant to wash the feet of the\r\n      servants of my lord\" (1 Samuel 25). Yet, Jesus washed the disciples feet\r\n      and served many on the cross who have received Him through faith. Yes, we\r\n      are not worthy, but we can make ourselves worthy by living a holy and\r\n      perfect life.\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Philippians 2'\">\r\n        Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in\r\n        my presence but much more in my absence, work\r\n        <b>out</b> your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who\r\n        works <b>in</b> you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Ephesians 4'\">\r\n        As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of\r\n        the calling you have received.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 22'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        For many are called, but few are chosen. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      We have been forgiven of our sins which were in our accounts, stored up\r\n      against us by our transgressions under the former covenant.

In the last day when Jesus\r\n      returns, He will settle accounts with those who were credited (Matthew\r\n      25). So, we see that, because of our gifts, we have an obligation to\r\n      barter or invest to earn more: we are in debt to produce more even after\r\n      we have been forgiven our debts! Remember the parable of the four soils?\r\n      Only one soil was good and fertile, producing a crop: 30, 60, or even 100\r\n      times more than what was planted (Matthew 13). A sign of maturity and\r\n      abiding in Christ is reproduction: as the Scriptures say, \"Be fruitful and\r\n      multiply\" (Genesis 1). Yes, our fruit is good for multiplying, and we bear\r\n      much fruit abiding in Him.

These psalms also show\r\n      the importance of not forgetting what we heard at first; the Book of\r\n      Hebrews also is good to read which calls all believers to HOLD FAST our\r\n      confession and hope in Christ, persevering in the Lord until the end. We\r\n      remember the Lord and what He has done for us through confession of our\r\n      lips, proclaiming His deeds to our neighbors. We ought to always be\r\n      growing in love and faith and good works to all people, especially to\r\n      those in the household of faith; if we grow in this way, we will be\r\n      effective in our knowledge of Christ Jesus.\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'James 5'\">\r\n        Be patient, then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord’s coming. See how\r\n        the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently\r\n        waiting for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand\r\n        firm, because the Lord’s coming is near. Don’t grumble against one\r\n        another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. The Judge is\r\n        standing at the door! Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in\r\n        the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the\r\n        Lord. As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered. You\r\n        have heard of Job’s perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally\r\n        brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Corinthians 15'\">\r\n        Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached\r\n        to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.

But if there is no\r\n        resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if\r\n        Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith\r\n        is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we\r\n        testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it\r\n        is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised,\r\n        not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your\r\n        faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have\r\n        fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this\r\n        life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. (...) Listen, I tell\r\n        you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— in an\r\n        instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the\r\n        trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be\r\n        changed. For the perishable must be clothed with the imperishable, and\r\n        the mortal with immortality. When the perishable has been clothed with\r\n        the imperishable and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that\r\n        is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”\r\n        “Where, O Death, is your victory? Where, O Death, is your sting?” The\r\n        sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to\r\n        God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      If you want to see what sin is, look at death: it's disgusting, repugnant,\r\n      dysfunctional, horrifying and stinky; yet that's what presently lives in\r\n      us as our bodies are actively decaying and becoming weaker & weaker,\r\n      gravitating towards a point of utter weakness which is death. Since Jesus\r\n      was raised from the dead by the power of the Spirit, so will God raise our\r\n      mortal bodies from the grave by the power of the Spirit. Although,\r\n      presently, we may have sin, we constantly strive to be blameless in all\r\n      matters to be perfect as our Father is perfect, so we can be made\r\n      complete, in all fullness of Spirit and maturity of Christ. The old nature\r\n      we had has been crucified on the cross and done away with, but we fight\r\n      temptation and sin actively every day, putting on the full armor of God\r\n      (Ephesians 6), standing firm against the evil one, fleeing from\r\n      immorality, idolatry, and youthful lusts, so that, when we die, we don't\r\n      remain as one who is dead, but sleep because we are alive to God as one\r\n      from the dead. As it is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 6'\">\r\n        Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with\r\n        him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die\r\n        again; death no longer has dominion over him.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      What then happens to those who sleep in death? They wake up and continue\r\n      to live. So it is with us who live as alive to God in Christ Jesus. As it\r\n      is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 22'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. For\r\n        in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but\r\n        are like angels of God in heaven. But concerning the resurrection of the\r\n        dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying, 'I am the\r\n        God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? God is not the\r\n        God of the dead, but of the living. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      This is the great hope we hold onto: \"For in this hope we were saved. But\r\n      hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?\r\n      But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience\"\r\n      (Romans 8) & \"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance\r\n      about what we do not see\" (Hebrews 11). And that confidence and assurance\r\n      comes by the Word of God, of the prophesies of the prophets, by\r\n      foretelling the Psalms, through the blessings of the Law, all testifying\r\n      to Jesus Christ and what He has done to be received by faith by us who are\r\n      at the culmination of the age, awaiting His return. We do not slack or be\r\n      sluggish, having thought in our minds that we have already obtained\r\n      salvation, but eagerly awaiting salvation working out what God has worked\r\n      in us with fear and trembling. For God is severe and kind: kind to us who\r\n      remain by faith in His kindness and severe to those who shrink back in\r\n      fear or disbelief (Romans 11). Indeed, we must remain in the faith until\r\n      the end, otherwise we have believed in vain. As for the Day of the Lord,\r\n      it will be day to us who live according to the day time and night to those\r\n      who walk not according to the Light, but according to the evil deeds of\r\n      darkness:\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Thessalonians 5'\">\r\n        Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need of\r\n        anything to be written to you. For you yourselves know full well that\r\n        the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night. While they\r\n        are saying, “Peace and safety!” then destruction will come upon them\r\n        suddenly like labor pains upon a woman with child, and they will not\r\n        escape. But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would\r\n        overtake you like a thief; for you are all sons of light and sons of\r\n        day. We are not of night nor of darkness; so then let us not sleep as\r\n        others do, but let us be alert and sober. For those who sleep do their\r\n        sleeping at night, and those who get drunk at night. But since we are of\r\n        the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and\r\n        love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. For God has not destined\r\n        us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\n        who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live\r\n        together with Him. Therefore encourage one another and build up one\r\n        another, just as you also are doing.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg11\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg1\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Spiritual Bodies</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 8'\">\r\n        For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did\r\n        not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have\r\n        received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”\r\n        The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of\r\n        God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with\r\n        Christ, provided <b>we suffer with Him</b> in order that we may also be\r\n        glorified with Him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present\r\n        time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to\r\n        us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the\r\n        sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly,\r\n        but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself\r\n        will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom\r\n        of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation\r\n        has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not\r\n        only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the\r\n        Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the\r\n        redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that\r\n        is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for\r\n        what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Philippians 3'\">\r\n        But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.\r\n        Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of\r\n        knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of\r\n        all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ\r\n        and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes\r\n        from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the\r\n        righteousness from God that depends on faith— that I may know him and\r\n        the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming\r\n        like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the\r\n        resurrection from the dead. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      The promise of the inheritance is contingent on our present sufferings\r\n      with Christ (see also 1 Thessalonians 3 + 2 Thessalonians 2) the\r\n      fellowship of His sufferings, sharing in His afflictions through our faith\r\n      in Him: since Christ suffered and gave Himself up for us, not living for\r\n      Himself, but for God, following His will even to death even that on a\r\n      cross, we also pick up our cross and suffer for the sake of Christ,\r\n      bearing His reproach and living not for our own wills, but for God's will\r\n      because of His great love revealed to us in Christ Jesus our Lord. We obey\r\n      Christ in this way, following His example for He is the Way and His\r\n      directives do direct us to eternal life so they are not burdensome.\r\n      Everything He commands us to do, He, our Commander, has done for us, and\r\n      we are His soldiers of His heavenly legion with weapons of war of good in\r\n      the right hand and the left, fighting the good fight of the faith, tearing\r\n      down the strongholds of the enemy which are his lies. We constantly hand\r\n      ourselves over to death so that the life of Jesus may be expressed in our\r\n      mortal body. So we see then, the newness of flesh is not just something to\r\n      be partaken in the future, but is also partaken in the present: the more\r\n      we die, the more Christ fills us. \"For we who are alive are always being\r\n      given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in\r\n      our mortal body.\" (2 Corinthians 4) and \"Therefore bear fruit in keeping\r\n      with repentance\" (Matthew 3).For this is the goal: to be filled with the\r\n      fullness of the Spirit & to be grown into the maturity of the Christ & to\r\n      be in resemblance of the perfection and holiness of the Father & to be in\r\n      unity in the body of Christ with one mind and purpose, loving one another.\r\n      We see then, our bodies are growing to be like Christ and will be in the\r\n      future like Christ's spiritual body. <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Corinthians 15'\">\r\n        But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body\r\n        do they come?” You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life\r\n        unless it dies. And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a\r\n        bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain. But God gives it a\r\n        body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body. For not\r\n        all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for\r\n        animals, another for birds, and another for fish. There are heavenly\r\n        bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind,\r\n        and the glory of the earthly is of another. There is one glory of the\r\n        sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for\r\n        star differs from star in glory. So is it with the resurrection of the\r\n        dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It is\r\n        sown in dishonor; git is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is\r\n        raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual\r\n        body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. Thus\r\n        it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam\r\n        became a life-giving spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first\r\n        but the natural, and then the spiritual. The first man was from the\r\n        earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. As was the man of\r\n        dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of\r\n        heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. Just as we have borne the\r\n        image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of\r\n        heaven.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg1\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg1\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light floater\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Eternal Judgement</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip\r\n        [reference]=\"'Revelation 2, 3, 21'\"\r\n        [isJesusWord]=\"true\"\r\n      >\r\n        To him who <b>overcomes</b> I will give to eat from the tree of life,\r\n        which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.

All of us in Christ Jesus, have been forgiven of our sins,\r\n      the debt that was in our account that testified against us, stored up\r\n      under the former covenant when we walked according to the flesh and were\r\n      by nature children of wrath, now, after our accounts have been cleared,\r\n      God has credited into our account gifts from the Spirit so that we would\r\n      gain more with what He has entrusted to us. The stewardship that we have\r\n      is to build up and edify the church and also, bartering and trading our\r\n      talents and winning more. Paul never built on another man's foundation\r\n      (Romans 15), but laid his own, so he would know what type it is. Let us\r\n      beware that we not build on any foundation other than the one that has\r\n      been laid: Jesus Christ, the Rock of foundation and the Chief cornerstone.\r\n      As it is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 6'\">\r\n        If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones,\r\n        wood, hay or straw, their work will be shown for what it is, because the\r\n        Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire\r\n        will test the quality of each personʼs work. If what has been built\r\n        survives, the builder will receive a reward. If it is burned up, the\r\n        builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved — even though only as one\r\n        escaping through the flames. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      If we are faithful with little, we will be faithful with much and Christ\r\n      will put us in charge of many things (Matthew 25). Winning more is like\r\n      gambling. We play the slot machines spending some of our money in order to\r\n      hit a jackpot and win more. Do all slot machines hit the jackpot? Is all\r\n      soil good and fertile? If the soil is bad, the seed that was cast on the\r\n      soil is wasted; there is nothing wrong with the seed, but the soil is the\r\n      problem. The money going in the slot machine is wasted, unless it produces\r\n      a yield. Does one know beforehand whether the soil is going to be bad or\r\n      not? What about if a machine will win? Not so, otherwise there would be no\r\n      room for chance and everything would yield - everyone would profit. God is\r\n      sovereign in all areas even in chance; He provides the growth of the seed,\r\n      and He makes the lot fall and He puts things in our way at just the right\r\n      time. We trust Him as we operate this dark world as He is our Light; trust\r\n      in the Light. This all assumes the seed is good and the money is good;\r\n      there is a bad seed which is called a lie. Does someone attempt to sell a\r\n      car speak dishonestly in his ad? No, otherwise when the person comes to\r\n      see the car in reality, they will see you have lied; he will be angry with\r\n      you because you wasted his time, and he will have a distrust for all car\r\n      salesmen because of that one experience; he will say, \"Those car salesmen\r\n      are all no good\". So we see how terrible a lie is! Also, how terrible\r\n      stereotyping is. Make sure your seed is good; that you are taught by the\r\n      Son of God and that you practice first before casting, lest yourself be\r\n      disqualified for the prize in the end. What the heart is full of, the\r\n      mouth speaks and whoever loves and practices a lie will not inherit the\r\n      Kingdom of God (Revelation 22). <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 25'\" [isJesusWord]=\"true\">\r\n        When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him,\r\n        then he will sit on his glorious throne.

For I was hungry and\r\n        you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger\r\n        and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you\r\n        visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ Then the righteous will\r\n        answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or\r\n        thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and\r\n        welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in\r\n        prison and visit you?’ And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to\r\n        you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it\r\n        to me.’ “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you\r\n        cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For\r\n        I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no\r\n        drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did\r\n        not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ Then they\r\n        also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty\r\n        or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to\r\n        you?’ Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did\r\n        not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ And\r\n        these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into\r\n        eternal life.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg1\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"filler-light\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">Everlasting Life</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      We, being in the tent of our body, look forward to our permanent home and\r\n      eternal life which God has promised us. The tent is not our permanent\r\n      home, but the tent is temporary and taken down; so it is with our bodies,\r\n      but we look forward to our heavenly home and eternal life and new bodies.\r\n      Following God will make you different, as the One who called you is holy,\r\n      so be holy; and this is what is holiness: different, special, set apart;\r\n      the world also has a word for this: weird. However, if the world is from\r\n      below, and we are from above, certainly we will be as aliens or foreigners\r\n      to them, a strange and peculiar people. As the Spirit says in Hebrews,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Hebrews 11'\">\r\n        All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen\r\n        them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that\r\n        they were <b>strangers and exiles</b> on the earth. For those who say\r\n        such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.\r\n        And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they\r\n        went out, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they\r\n        desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not\r\n        ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      and as Peter says,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Peter 2'\">\r\n        Beloved, I urge you as <b>aliens and strangers</b> to abstain from\r\n        fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <br /><br />\r\n\r\n      Know that there is only one Way: that is Jesus Christ. There are many\r\n      other paths, but all those lead to an end which is a dead end - they are\r\n      not eternal and do not go on forever. However, the Way is eternal and the\r\n      Way is narrow; the Way is Christ, and He has gone before us to be the\r\n      first to be raised from the dead, and He lives forever; this gives us\r\n      assurance that if we live as He lived, we will also inherit eternal life:\r\n      we follow Him and receive the same reward. Those who believe in Him, also\r\n      trust and follow Him; and those who follow Him, do as He did; and those\r\n      who do as He did, will receive the reward He received. Those who do not\r\n      pick up their cross and follow Him, are not worthy of Him (Matt 16). Not\r\n      many will follow after Him, but we are not like the many, but like the few\r\n      who persist in faith. As it is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Matthew 7'\">\r\n        Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the\r\n        road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is\r\n        the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      and\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Romans 6'\">\r\n        For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in\r\n        Christ Jesus our Lord. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      There is a walk by faith, but that does not imply that it will be easy.\r\n      The way of faith is also a run: we run the race of faith, keeping our eyes\r\n      on Jesus. This concept is similar to the spiritual milk, we have as\r\n      newborn babes in Christ; milk is good when you're young, but when you get\r\n      more mature in Christ, you'll move onto solid food. Likewise, as children\r\n      we first learn how to walk by faith, then as we walk in the light and gain\r\n      confidence, we begin to run the race of faith. Walking may be easy, but\r\n      when you begin to run, you're exerting a lot more effort, aren't you? And\r\n      those who run in a race, do so to win a crown in the end that will perish;\r\n      how much more do we who inherit for an everlasting? Let us really consider\r\n      how hard it is to be saved, as it is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Peter 4'\">\r\n        For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it\r\n        begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who disobey the\r\n        gospel of God? And, If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what\r\n        will become of the ungodly and the sinner?\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      Also be encouraged by remembering when the disciples asked the Lord in\r\n      regard to the rich man entering into the kingdom, \"Who then can be saved?\"\r\n      and Jesus answered,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Mark 10'\" isJesusWord=\"true\">\r\n        With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      <br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Deuteronomy 30'\">\r\n        See, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and\r\n        adversity; in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to\r\n        walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His\r\n        judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that the Lord your God\r\n        may bless you in the land where you are entering to possess it. But if\r\n        your heart turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and\r\n        worship other gods and serve them, I declare to you today that you shall\r\n        surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you are\r\n        crossing the Jordan to enter and possess it. I call heaven and earth to\r\n        witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death,\r\n        the blessing and the curse. So choose life in order that you may live,\r\n        you and your descendants, by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His\r\n        voice, and by holding fast to Him; for this is your life and the length\r\n        of your days, that you may live in the land which the Lord swore to your\r\n        fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg24\">\r\n  <div class=\"\">\r\n    <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"pimg24\">\r\n  <section class=\"section section-light floater\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"headers\">New Heavens and New Earth</h2>\r\n    <p class=\"paragraphs\">\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Isaiah 65'\">\r\n        For behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things\r\n        will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind. But be glad and\r\n        rejoice forever in what I create; for I will create Jerusalem to be a\r\n        joy and its people to be a delight. I will rejoice in Jerusalem and take\r\n        delight in My people. The sounds of weeping and crying will no longer be\r\n        heard in her. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'Revelation 21'\">\r\n        Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and earth\r\n        had passed away, and the sea was no more. saw the holy city, the new\r\n        Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride\r\n        adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne\r\n        saying: “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man, and He will\r\n        dwell with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with\r\n        them as their God. ‘He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,’ and\r\n        there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the\r\n        former things have passed away.” And the One seated on the throne said,\r\n        “Behold, I make all things new.” Then He said, “Write this down, for\r\n        these words are faithful and true.” </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      We have been created new in Christ Jesus if He indeed has given us His\r\n      Spirit & cut away our old nature with a circumcision not done by human\r\n      hands. Only the new creation will inherit the kingdom of God; flesh and\r\n      blood cannot enter the kingdom of God. In Genesis, God created the present\r\n      world and humanity and all other flesh in 6 days; He will also create the\r\n      new heavens and new earth which He promised, making all things new, as a\r\n      place where righteousness dwells; for this present heavens and earth are\r\n      corrupt and everything rots and decays with use over time because of the\r\n      dysfunction of the fallen human nature and the death & destruction that\r\n      comes from it; but the new heavens and new earth will be a place that does\r\n      not decay nor wear out like a garment, a place where righteousness dwells.\r\n      For just as God did away with the ancient world with a flood and afterward\r\n      only Noah and his family (who were righteous) survived on the earth, so\r\n      will it be when God floods the world again with fire, preserving the\r\n      righteous who will inherit the new earth: God is preparing a place for us.\r\n      The first of the new creation is Jesus Christ, Who is the firstfruits of\r\n      the resurrection, and firstfruits of the new creation; this new creation\r\n      is not born from will of man, but born of the Spirit. For everything of\r\n      the old is passing away and only the work of the new will remain; we who\r\n      are created anew in Christ Jesus will inherit all these things if we\r\n      persevere until the end. In the beginning, God created everything that we\r\n      can see; and His work that we do not see is being reenacted in us as it\r\n      was in the beginning. As it is written,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'2 Corinthians 4'\">\r\n        For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One who\r\n        has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory\r\n        of God in the face of Christ. </blog-reference-tooltip\r\n      ><br />\r\n\r\n      We are being built up and edified as living stones into a spiritual house,\r\n      the new Jerusalem that will come out of heaven in which we will dwell as a\r\n      holy priesthood, a chosen race, a peculiar people for God's own\r\n      possession. As the Truth living in Peter says,\r\n      <blog-reference-tooltip [reference]=\"'1 Peter 2'\">\r\n        And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men,\r\n        but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as living\r\n        stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood,\r\n        to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.\r\n      </blog-reference-tooltip>\r\n      In the Revelation of Jesus Christ, we see there are 144,000 that are\r\n      preserved from the earth, sealed with a mark on their foreheads from the\r\n      plagues that came upon the earth. Likewise, the city is 12,000 cubits in\r\n      length, breadth, and height. The measure of the wall of the city is 144\r\n      cubits and the foundation of the wall has twelve gates each with pearl and\r\n      inscribed a name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The wall also\r\n      having twelve foundations with precious stones written the names of the\r\n      twelve apostles of the Lamb. Also promised to us is a white stone written\r\n      on it a new name that no one knows except the one who receives it. Glory\r\n      be to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </section>\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"pimg24\">\r\n    <div class=\"\">\r\n      <span class=\"trans\"> </span>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n"],"x_google_ignoreList":[0]}
