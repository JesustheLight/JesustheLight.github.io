We don't know where we are going: we can't say what will happen tomorrow. All we know is today: all we know is right now. Today, is the day of salvation: right now, is the time of God's favor. When you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts. The root of all disobedience and sin is unbelief; therefore, re-assure yourself with the confidence which comes from faith in Jesus Christ.
